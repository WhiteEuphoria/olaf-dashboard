# Admin Dashboard Refactor Progress (Legacy Filament Notes)

> **Note:** The project no longer uses Filament panels. The details below remain for historical context only and do not reflect the current Blade implementation.

## What was attempted
- Added a custom Filament page class `App\\Filament\\Pages\\AdminDashboard` with slide-over actions (support message, withdrawal, fraud claim).
- (Legacy) Replaced the default Filament dashboard view with a custom Blade layout at `resources/views/filament/admin/pages/dashboard.blade.php`.
- Wired the new page as the admin panel home in `App\\Providers\\Filament\\AdminPanelProvider`.

## Current issues
- The Blade view still renders mostly static demo markup; dynamic bindings aren't wired to live data yet (sections like accounts, transactions, documents remain placeholders).
- Actions were scaffolded but need real business logic (validation, service calls, notifications).
- Route helpers in the Blade view must be checked once the Filament panel boots; CLI verification fails outside a full request lifecycle.

## Next steps (recommended)
1. Replace static datasets with real Livewire-driven collections (hydrate from selected user, add loading states, empty messaging).
2. Implement filtering / search so admins can switch clients quickly and ensure dependent sections update reactively.
3. Hook the modal actions into existing services (support chat, withdrawal workflow, fraud claim handling) and add success/error feedback.
4. Align the styling with the reference mock using Tailwind classes or extracted components so the layout stays maintainable.
